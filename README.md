# OpenSynth

OpenSynth is an open cyberpunk dystopian universe built to stay open — for creators, fans, studios, and hobbyists.

The goal is simple: **anyone can create in OpenSynth**, commercially or non-commercially, without permission bottlenecks — while protecting the **OpenSynth name**, preventing **canon hijacking**, and ensuring the universe can **evolve over time**.

## What’s in this repo?

This repository is the **home of the OpenSynth website source** and the official public text for:

- **OCUL license** (how OpenSynth can be used)
- **Community FAQ** (plain-English guidance and expectations)

These documents are intended to be:
- present in the repo root for GitHub readers,
- and also published as part of the website.

## Quick Rules (Plain English)

You can:
- build games, books, comics, music, mods, tools — anything
- remix, rewrite, or ignore parts of the lore
- sell your derived work (commercial use is allowed)

You must:
- **credit OpenSynth**
- **not** title/brand your product as “OpenSynth” or imply it is official canon
- respect **derived-work name protection** (don’t make “Mercs 2” without permission from whoever made Mercs)

OpenSynth itself may:
- evolve over time
- adopt community-born improvements as *remix/derivative evolution* (not 1:1 copying)
- document significant revisions publicly where practical
