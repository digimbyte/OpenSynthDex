## 0. Purpose & Philosophy

OpenSynth is an open cyberpunk dystopian universe designed to grow through community use, remixing, and evolution.

This license exists to:
- enable unrestricted creative and commercial use,
- prevent brand, name, and canon hijacking,
- and ensure OpenSynth can continue evolving without being frozen, captured, or litigated by its own derivatives.

OpenSynth is not a static work. It is a living universe.

## 1. Definitions

**1.1 “OpenSynth Universe”**  
The shared fictional cyberpunk dystopian setting known as OpenSynth, including its lore, concepts, characters, factions, locations, themes, art, music, terminology, and narrative elements released under this license.

**1.2 “Licensed Material”**  
Any OpenSynth content released by the Licensor and marked as covered by this license.

**1.3 “Your Work”**  
Any work that uses, adapts, remixes, references, or is set within the OpenSynth Universe.

**1.4 “Official Branding”**  
Use of the OpenSynth name, logos, or marks as a primary product title, franchise label, publisher name, store listing name, or branding implying official status.

**1.5 “Canon Claim”**  
Any claim or implication that a work is official, canonical, endorsed, approved, or part of the authoritative OpenSynth storyline.

**1.6 “OpenSynth Clone”**  
A project that presents itself as a community clone/continuation of OpenSynth, or distributes the OpenSynth Universe as a standalone or competing “mainline” universe package (including forks intended to replace or re-host the universe itself), especially where OpenSynth is used in branding, naming, or positioning.

**1.7 “Publish” / “Publication”**  
To distribute, release, sell, share, upload, or otherwise make available to any third party (publicly or privately), including early access, closed betas, Patreon builds, and client deliveries.

## 2. Grant of Rights (Very Broad)

Subject to this license, the Licensor grants you a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to:

- use, copy, modify, remix, adapt, and redistribute the Licensed Material;
- create unlimited derivative works within the OpenSynth Universe;
- distribute those works commercially or non-commercially;
- license your original contributions under any terms you choose.

No permission is required. No royalties are owed.

---

## 3. Attribution (Mandatory)

Any public release of Your Work must include attribution.

Minimum attribution:

“Set in the OpenSynth universe created by [YOUR NAME / STUDIO].  
Used under the OpenSynth Community Universe License (OCUL).”

Attribution must be reasonably visible.

---

## 4. Non-Endorsement (Mandatory)

You may not imply that your work is endorsed, approved, or officially part of OpenSynth unless you have written permission.

Recommended disclaimer:

“This is an unofficial work set in the OpenSynth universe and is not endorsed by the original creator.”

---

## 5. Name, Branding & Canon Protection (Hard Boundary)

### 5.1 OpenSynth Name Protection

You may not:
- title a work “OpenSynth”, “OpenSynth 2”, or similar;
- present a work as an official sequel, reboot, remake, or canon continuation;
- use OpenSynth as a franchise, studio, or publisher brand.

Truthful descriptive use is allowed (e.g., “set in the OpenSynth universe”).

### 5.2 No Canon Authority

No derived work may claim authority over OpenSynth canon, direction, or evolution.

---

## 6. Derived-Work Name Protection

Each independently named derived project owns its project name identity.

If a creator releases a project named “Mercs”:
- others may not release “Mercs 2”, “Mercs Redux”, or continuations without that creator’s permission.

This protects creators without restricting the universe.

---

## 7. Evolution, Adoption & Feedback Clause (Core Rule)

### 7.1 OpenSynth May Evolve Freely

OpenSynth may revise, refine, expand, or rework itself over time based on:
- internal development,
- community feedback,
- observed patterns,
- and ideas emerging from derived or remixed works.

This evolution is a core condition of this license.

### 7.2 Adoption is Remix, Not 1:1 Copying

By creating and publishing a work within the OpenSynth Universe, you acknowledge and agree that:

- OpenSynth may adopt, reinterpret, or refine general concepts, improvements, structures, or enhancements that emerge from the community;
- any such adoption is not a 1:1 replication of your work, and will take the form of OpenSynth’s own remix/derivative evolution;
- adoption does not transfer ownership of your specific project, name, narrative execution, or expressive work;
- OpenSynth will not republish or rebrand your full project as its own.

This clause exists to prevent stagnation, veto power, or retroactive ownership claims.

### 7.3 No “Reverse Ownership” Claims

No derived work may claim that OpenSynth:
- “stole” its evolution,
- is blocked from future refinement,
- or must seek permission to improve itself.

OpenSynth remains free to grow.

### 7.4 Documentation of Significant Revisions

Significant revisions to OpenSynth will be documented as versioned updates, revision notes, or publicly visible change records where practical.

---

## 8. Clones, Forks, and License Integrity (Hard Requirement)

### 8.1 OCUL Must Remain Verbatim for OpenSynth Clones

If you publish or distribute an OpenSynth Clone, you must:
- distribute it under this same OCUL license text verbatim (no edits, no added restrictions, no removed rights);
- include the full, unmodified OCUL text with the clone;
- and present it as a community continuation that preserves OpenSynth’s “pay it forward” openness.

### 8.2 No Modified OCUL Variants Presented as OpenSynth

You may not:
- publish a modified version of OCUL and call it “OCUL” (or imply it is the OCUL license);
- present a modified-license fork/clone as an OpenSynth clone, continuation, or OpenSynth-aligned successor.

Any exception requires written legal approval from the Licensor.

### 8.3 This Does Not Force Share-Alike on Ordinary Works

Section 8 applies to OpenSynth Clones only.  
Ordinary derived works (Your Work) may be licensed under any terms you choose, provided you follow OCUL’s attribution and naming rules.

---

## 9. No Share-Alike Requirement (For Ordinary Works)

You are not required to:
- open-source your work,
- license your additions under OCUL,
- or contribute back.

Sharing is encouraged, never enforced.

---

## 10. Lawful Use Only

Licensed Material may not be used for unlawful purposes.

---

## 11. No Warranty

The OpenSynth Universe is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Licensor is not liable for damages arising from use of OpenSynth or derived works.

---

## 13. Termination

If you violate this license:
- rights terminate automatically;
- rights are reinstated if cured within 30 days;
- repeated or malicious violations may result in permanent termination.

---

## 14. OCUL Is a Living License (No Version Picking)

There is only one OCUL: the current, latest published OCUL text.

When you Publish Your Work, you must comply with the latest OCUL in effect at the time of that Publication.

If you later re-Publish (e.g., update, re-release, re-upload, ship a new build, new edition, new platform), you must comply with the latest OCUL in effect at that later Publication.

This section governs the license terms. It does not force you to update or adopt any particular version of OpenSynth content.

---

## 15. OpenSynth Content Versioning (Separate From OCUL)

OpenSynth Universe content may evolve and be released in versions/revisions over time.

You may base Your Work on any OpenSynth content revision you choose (old or new), provided you comply with the latest OCUL at the time you Publish.

---

## 16. Governing Law

This license is governed by the laws of [STATE / COUNTRY].
