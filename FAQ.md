# OpenSynth – Community FAQ

## What is OpenSynth?
OpenSynth is an open cyberpunk dystopian universe designed for anyone to build or create in—commercially or non-commercially—with minimal restriction and maximum creative freedom.

## Why does OpenSynth exist?
The creator wanted a cyberpunk universe that wouldn’t get locked behind rights confusion, corporate ownership drift, or permission bottlenecks. OpenSynth exists to keep fan creation and expansion alive long-term.

## Is OpenSynth a remake or clone of another IP?
No. OpenSynth contains no direct references, characters, factions, or storylines from other IPs. It uses only common cyberpunk genre concepts (megacities, corporations, implants, dystopia), which are general genre territory.

## Do I have to use all of OpenSynth?
No. Use what you like:
- only the lore,
- only a concept,
- only a faction idea,
- or a single location.
You can discard or rewrite anything else.

## Can I change, butcher, or rewrite the lore?
Yes. Fully. Most works are expected to be:
- expansions,
- alternative timelines,
- parallel universes,
- or personal interpretations.
There is no requirement to conform to any single “complete” version.

## Can I make money from an OpenSynth-based project?
Yes. Commercial use is allowed. No permission required. No royalties owed.
Attribution is required.

## Do I need to open-source my work?
No. Your project can be open or closed, free or paid, permissive or proprietary. OCUL does not impose share-alike on ordinary derived works.

## What credit do I need to give?
Example:
“Set in the OpenSynth universe created by Digimbyte, used under the OpenSynth Community Universe License (OCUL).”
Put it somewhere visible (credits/description/README).

## Can I call my game “OpenSynth” or “OpenSynth 2”?
No. The OpenSynth name is protected. You can say:
- “Set in the OpenSynth universe”
But you cannot title/brand your product as OpenSynth or present it as an official sequel.

## What about my own project name?
Your project name is protected inside the community.
If Tom releases a project called “Mercs”, nobody else can release:
- “Mercs 2”
- “Mercs Redux”
- “Mercs Remastered”
without Tom’s permission.
This prevents sequel hijacking while keeping the universe open.

## Can OpenSynth revise itself over time?
Yes. OpenSynth is allowed to evolve—this is part of the agreement.
OpenSynth can revise lore, terminology, structures, and concepts as the setting matures, and significant changes will be documented as revisions where practical.

## Can OpenSynth adopt ideas from derived works?
Yes, this is intentional.
OpenSynth may adopt improvements and enhancements that emerge from OpenSynth-based works, but adoption is never a 1:1 re-release of someone else’s project. Any adoption will be OpenSynth’s own remix/derivative evolution.

Creators still own:
- their project name,
- their original contributions and specific expression (storylines, characters, scenes, art, music, code),
- and the unique identity of their project.

By publishing within OpenSynth, creators also grant the OpenSynth Foundation an express, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive right to adopt, remix, and evolve OpenSynth using ideas and improvements that emerge from OpenSynth-based works, without reproducing the creator’s specific expression 1:1 and without taking ownership of the creator’s project or specific expression.

## Do I get veto power over OpenSynth if I build something big?
No. The “pay it forward” premise is that OpenSynth can learn from its ecosystem without being frozen by downstream claims.

## Can I make an OpenSynth clone/fork and change the license?
No.
If you publish an OpenSynth clone/continuation, you must use OCUL verbatim—no edits, no restrictions, no “new OCUL version.”
Any change requires written legal approval from the Licensor.

If you don’t want to use OCUL verbatim, you can still make your own cyberpunk universe—just don’t present it as an OpenSynth clone/continuation.

## Which OCUL version do I use?
You don’t choose. There is only one OCUL: the latest.
Whenever you publish or distribute your work, you must comply with the latest OCUL in effect at that time.

## Can I use older or newer OpenSynth lore revisions?
Yes. OpenSynth content can have revisions/versions. You can build on whichever OpenSynth content revision you prefer.
That choice is separate from OCUL: regardless of which OpenSynth revision you use, you must follow the latest OCUL when you publish.

## One-line summary
Build anything in OpenSynth, sell it if you want, credit the universe, don’t hijack names or claim official status, and understand OpenSynth is allowed to evolve by remixing improvements from the community.
